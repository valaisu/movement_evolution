Some ideas for the learning algorithm:

- PPO, apparently popular
- DQN, good for limited action space
- DQN variants (address the issues of DQN)
- Soft Actor-Critic, great for continuous control
- TD3, great for continuous deterministic combo
- DDPG, TD3 but simpler

Difficulty order by Claude:
    DQN
    DDPG
    PPO
    TD3
    DQN variants
